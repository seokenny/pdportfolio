                        A huge issue that the analytics team brought to attention was the amount of carts abandoned. Customers would leave the website or cancel purchasing a rug because they were unsure of many components - how the rugs would look, fit, or how difficult it would be to keep clean.

                        I realized it wasn’t a simple issue of providing more information. A user needs to feel confident from start to finish. Hence, I laid out some goals that needed to be fulfilled to create that confident buying experience.

                    <p class="casecontain_para image_margin">
                        Rugs USA’s catalog page features a wide preview of rugs with filters to narrow down searches. Each rug has its own subset of information to give a general idea on the different variations and properties.
                        <br><br>
                        After consulting with the analytics team, we concluded that there were two main issues.

                    <p class="casecontain_para image_margin-top">
                        The <b>first issue</b> was the obscene amount of filters with no structure. There’s no issue with there being a huge selection of filters, but it becomes a hindrance when there is no organization between categories.
                        <br><br>
                        The <b>second issue</b> was the lack of useful information within each rug preview card. Crucial information was missing and users were annoyed at having to click on a product to view said information.

                </div>

                        After identifying the lack of structure, I first categorized each option based on relatability. This created an organized overview for users to find what they’re looking for with ease.
                        <br><br>
                        Since the rug preview cards were the main content of this page, I moved the most popular filters to the top. This provided a wider range of viewable cards per row - lessening the amount of scrolling.

                    <p class="casecontain_para image_margin">
                        Initially, the rug preview cards showed 3 pieces of information - color variations, rug name, and a sale banner. In the age of online shopping, this was nowhere near information. After reviewing what customers requested and viewing successful shopping experiences, I decided on adding 3 more crucial pieces of information - ratings and number of reviews, shipping details, and the actual amount calculated with the current sale.

                            <b>Ratings and number of reviews</b> are essential in a preview because it is a quick view of what other customers experienced with the possible product.

                        <li class="casecontain_li">
                            In a society where <b>fast shipment</b> can make or break sales, showing how fast a product is shipped gives customers more incentives to purchase a product.

                        The issue of the initial rug full view page was it provided similar information to the rug preview cards; it was too general and didn’t show specificity. Another issue was the lack of useful features to keep customers engaged. There was no personalized information or interactive and engaging features.

                        Also included was a glossary for terms that customers may not be familiar with. This broadened their knowledge for future rug purchases.

                        Knowing the needs of the customers is a huge part of confident purchases. It’s stressful for customers when they purchase an item that may or may not meet their expectations. Providing as much detail from different sources of information blocks can dissolve some of that uncertainty. A confident buyer results in more frequent purchases for the present and the future.
