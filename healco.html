                        HealCo is a web platform specifically made for medical hosts/guests to lease/rent a medically equipped and approved space based on their specialties. For hosts, it allowed easy enlistment of their properties while using a matchmaking system to connect with the ideal guest. For guests, it provided a variety of properties based on the different filters the guests selected.
                        <br><br>
                        HealCo also has a huge focus on telemedicine - a way for patients to receive medical assistance through digital and long distance means.

                        My role at HealCo was as a UX/UI Designer. I worked closely with 4 Full Stack Engineers and 2 analytics team members. The CEO was also heavily involved when it came to decision making.

                        There are 3 categories of users - hosts who were looking to rent out their medically approved space, guests who were looking for medically equipped and approved space, and the admins of HealCo who mediated the information, requests, and applications on the platform. While the hosts and guests have similar experiences, I had to keep in mind the extra features that admins would have through their journey.

                        As HealCo was still a relatively new company, most of their tasks were focused on the completion of its core features. This left the design at a bare minimum.
                        <br><br>
                        I was brought into HealCo to redesign the entire user interface and experience for their entire HealCo platform - this includes their website, form flows, and dashboard. One thing I had to keep in mind was scalability, as HealCo was still rapidly rolling out new features for its users.

                        Since I needed to redesign the entire HealCo platform, the first thing I needed to do was figure out and plan the flow direction for users. The end-to-end experience was crucial to keep users on track to fulfill all requirements sent by HealCo.

                        The biggest issue with HealCo’s initial website was the lack of information. Being the initial starting point for new users, it was crucial to give new visitors information, security, and confidence when applying for HealCo. Users had no idea what services HealCo provided, how it worked, and whether or not HealCo was a legitimate service. Before coming up with a design, I figured out the questions that users asked before committing to a product or service. This information was used to determine the necessary information the website would provide to users.

                        Although users received their personalized dashboards, the information and services provided were all over the place.

There was also a lack of any indications of current progression. Providing the user “what” and “where” they are in any current session is important to keep them on track and being transparent.
